* Mouse wheel: camera zoom
* Direction arrows: camera movement
* Left shift: fast movement
* F: focus the current or first selected gameobject
* Left-Alt: fixed camera orbit to the selected gameobject while pressed

## Tips: 
* By default camera rotation orbits the current point, so it's not needed to press alt key continously.
* Zoom and camera movement change orbit reference, to avoid keeping alt key pressed just press F key again to re-center.
